[00:00.000 --> 00:08.640]  Hello, good morning, my name is Alain Polito and now I will talk about a little thing that
[00:08.640 --> 00:11.680]  I did today, okay?
[00:11.680 --> 00:18.400]  The main thing that I did is logout bottom of my website.
[00:18.400 --> 00:29.720]  This logout button basically will delete the cookie of my browser.
[00:29.720 --> 00:42.760]  I had some problems about this because in the server side, really, I don't ensure that
[00:42.760 --> 00:49.560]  the cookie will delete correctly, okay?
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.040]  Only in client side I can delete this cookie.
[00:54.040 --> 01:05.720]  I don't have the way certain for did this correctly, but I will search this and when
[01:05.720 --> 01:12.200]  I found I will did correctly, okay?
[01:12.200 --> 01:28.360]  So I had some problems in deploy today because I had a memorial leak problem with my NetJS
[01:28.360 --> 01:31.400]  server.
[01:31.400 --> 01:48.120]  Talking about libraries of monitoring, I found out the permatails with library NetJS permatails.
[01:48.120 --> 02:01.240]  I think that I will bring these permatails for my application for monitoring and understand
[02:01.240 --> 02:09.800]  what happened with my application and why my application is occurring in the memorial
[02:09.800 --> 02:11.400]  leak problem.
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.440]  I don't know, it's probably occurring.
[02:16.440 --> 02:26.360]  Before it was occurring, but now it's occurring, okay?
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.000]  I think that's it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.720]  My login page, it's good in local, my local machine.
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.000]  Logout is working.
[02:41.000 --> 03:04.160]  Also it's important I explain or other thing that I will have that is I will have the problem
[03:04.160 --> 03:10.400]  with deleting cache in server side, really.
[03:10.400 --> 03:25.040]  My idea is when I delete session in my server, when I delete the session and the application
[03:25.040 --> 03:38.600]  catch this error because all routes of curing in GraphQL need the cookie to work and my
[03:38.600 --> 03:54.480]  idea and when these errors is catch for my site, he will delete the cookie, but it's
[03:54.480 --> 04:00.280]  not happened because I'm in server side already.
[04:00.280 --> 04:07.240]  I have a search, a solution for this and I think that's it.
[04:07.240 --> 04:12.000]  My project is working done.
[04:12.000 --> 04:32.440]  I had some problems with my routine and I will try to dump this project incorrectly
[04:32.440 --> 04:33.520]  that line, okay?
